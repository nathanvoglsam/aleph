# Project Back Under Control

- Need to audit that state of all the current crates and decide what needs to be done with each one.
  There's a lot of old code that hasn't been touched in over 6 months left in some state of
  completion or another. Need to figure out what is finished, what isn't, what is worth finishing
  and what should just be removed.
  
- Need a plan moving forward to get to something that actually works.

# Crate Statuses

## Unfinished, but should be completed

- `aleph-ktx`
    - Need to verify it matches the latest version of the spec
    - Need to complete file validation
- `aleph-vk-format`
    - Need to make sure this contains all vulkan formats
