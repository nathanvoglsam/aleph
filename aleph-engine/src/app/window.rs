///
/// A "namespace struct" similar to the `Engine` struct that is used to encapsulate the global
/// window. A game is almost never ever going to need more than one window unless you're doing some
/// super wacky stuff so rather than trying to support we embrace it and offer a cleaner interface.
///
/// The main drawback is that getting multiple windows working is going to be really janky to use
/// but I think the benefits of having such a convenient thread-safe interface is worth it.
///
/// Another thing to be aware of is that almost every function publicly exposed here will panic if
/// there is no window initialized. This can cause issues if running headless, hence the
/// `window_loaded` function to gate it. You're not going to be touching the window much anyway
/// outside of UI or input code so that probably shouldn't be shipping in a headless executable
/// anyway. The engine will initialize it for you so unless you're doing something weird it wont be
/// a problem regardless.
///
/// # Implementation Details
///
/// The window is only safe to directly touch on the main thread because reasonsâ„¢. The window
/// interface is thread-safe and accessible from any thread. To allow this the interface never
/// directly touches the window.
///
/// Underlying the window interface is a global request queue and a global window state object. Both
/// are gated behind locks. To change the window with one of the functions such as `set_title` a
/// request is pushed onto the request queue. The change will then actually take place on the next
/// frame.
///
/// At the beginning of each frame the main thread will consume the queued events and perform the
/// changes requested then update the global window state.
///
/// Because of this the state readable from this interface will be one frame out of date. The result
/// of a function like `set_title` will only be visible through the `title` function will only be
/// visible on the frame after `set_title` is called.
